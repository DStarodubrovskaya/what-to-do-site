						<span class="empesizedText">My Opinion:</span><br>
						"A film that has already become a classic. About the hard life in the fashion industry.<br>
						The actors perform at the highest level. And everything just screams: S-T-Y-L-E"
					</p>
					<!-- Description of the film -->
					<p>
						<strong>The Devil Wears Prada</strong> is a 2006 American comedy-drama film directed by David Frankel and produced by Wendy Finerman. 
						The screenplay, written by Aline Brosh McKenna, is based on the 2003 novel by Lauren Weisberger. The film stars Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, 
						and Stanley Tucci.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although the film is set in the fashion world, and references well-known establishments and people within that industry, 
						most designers and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, 
						who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories to be used in the film,
						making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film 
						and Streep in particular.
					</p>
					<!-- Plot summary -->
					<h2><strong>Plot</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Andy (Anne Hathaway) is a recent college graduate with big dreams. Upon landing a job at prestigious Runway magazine,
						she finds herself the assistant to diabolical editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). Andy questions her ability to survive her grim tour
						as Miranda's whipping girl without getting scorched.
